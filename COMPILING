Compiling & running the talker
------------------------------


To compile the talker:


Linux, AIX, IRIX, OSF : cc cryptv5.c -o server

HP-UX : cc -Ae cryptv5.c -o server  (you need the ANSI compiler)

SCO 3.2 : cc cryptv5.c -lsocket -lcrypt_i -o server

DYNIX 4 : cc cryptv5.c -lsocket -lnsl -o server

Solaris/SunOS : cc -lsocket -lnsl cryptv5.c -o server

Windows 95/NT: I have tested this under Borland C++ v4.5 and v5.0, load the 
file into the IDE and select WIN32 Console app, static libraries and turn
off all compiler warnings.  This should work in the same way for the Microsoft
compiler but I haven't tested it.  You should make sure the platform.h file
is set for a Windows compile.

Ignore any compiler warnings such as signal warnings on Solaris.  If the 
above compiler options do not work then try gcc instead (eg, gcc cryptv5.c -o
server). On FreeBSD you may need to include -lcrypt_i or use the ufc.c file included 
here (see platform.h). 

Note: I have only personally tested the Linux, Windows, OSF, Solaris & SunOS
compiles, if it does not work on your system only minor changes will be 
required, let me know what they are, and if you can't figure them out then 
let me know the errors you get when compiling and I'll try and fix it.

You can of course change the name of the object file from server to whatever
you want...  If you are running this 'without permission' (naughty you!) then
you could rename it to csh or gcc to disguise it on process lists ;)


To compile the extra files:

cc ncat.c -o ncat
cc userinfo.c -o userinfo
