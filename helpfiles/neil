Neil's Credits in the original version of Nuts

  NUTS stands for Neils Unix Talk Server, a program which started out as a
university project in autumn 1992 and has progressed from thereon. This
version of the software I plan to be the final ever release so in no
particular order thanks go to the following people who helped me develop or
debug this code in one way or another over the years:
~FT   Darren Seryck, Steve Guest, Dave Temple, Satish Bedi, Tim Bernhardt,
~FT   Kien Tran, Jesse Walton, Pak Chan and Scott MacKenzie.
Also thanks must go to anyone else who has emailed me with ideas and/or bug
reports and all the people who have used NUTS over the intervening three and
a half years. If you wish to email me my address is '~FGneil@ogham.demon.co.uk~RS'
and should remain so for the forseeable future.

Neil Robertson - July 1996.
