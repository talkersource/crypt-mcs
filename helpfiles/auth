~FT* auth *

Useage: auth user <wait-time> <<all>>

This command does an authentication check on a user.  It sends a query
to identd on users computer and reports the result (which should be
the users unix username/email address).  If the remote computer
is not running identd then an error is reported.  It's worth pointing
out that most users won't be on computers that run identd (eg, Windows
PC's) and it's very easy to forge an ident result on a PC, (eg, just
by running the MIRC IRC client).

~FRWARNING!~RS - This command can hang the talker while the 
authentication is taking place.  To get around this the command
will time out if a result isn't delivered quick enough.  You can
specify a time out in seconds if are querying a slow server.
  
If the all option is used with a time then the full string
returned by the server is shown.
