~FT* bsx *

Usage: .bsx user

This is a simple command that should print out a Crypt logo on the screen of
a user using an graphical version of Xtush using the BSX graphics protocol.

To test who is using xtush on the talker try typing ~FG.shout @RQV~RS which
is the xtush protocol to return the version number.  Any users that respond
to this (with the string !! User VER XWIN x.x) can be .bsx'd :)

There is also a command to instantly crash users using xtush but I won't
reveal it here :)
