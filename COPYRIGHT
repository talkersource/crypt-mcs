Crypt v5 - Copyright & Licensing
--------------------------------

This main code of this program (cryptv5.c & cryptv5.h) is based upon Nuts 
v3.2.1 by Neil Robertson.

This is Neil's original license:

---
If you alter the code could you please leave the credits in the code (.help 
credits) and also don't change the version so much that it doesn't say NUTS 
anymore when a user does the .version command. I find it annoying that after 
I've spent months of time working on this software someone comes along, changes
a few commands then pretends its all their own work. If you have a problem 
with any references to my name or the NUTS name being in your talker then 
don't use my software, its that simple, go write your own from scratch. 

This software is freeware, it is *NOT* public domain, I retain copyright, and 
since there is code in here that I have used in a commercial system I have 
written I will take legal action on anyone and their institution/employer who 
I find using it to their own commercial advantage by way of selling the code
of either this or a modified version. I have no problems with anyone running a 
pay-to-use talker using NUTS however.
        You are perfectly free to modify the code to suit your needs and 
distribute modified versions *BUT* if you do could you please leave my name,
the NUTS name and the code header in the code and also note the fact that the
code isn't 100% original.

Working from Neil's license it follows that the Crypt talker coder is freeware
and my be freely modified and distributed AS LONG AS:

1)  All of Neil's requests above are obeyed, with the additions that the 
.version command (including the one at login prompt) mentions that the talker 
is based on CryptCode as well as Nuts.  

2) My credits (.help credits) are retained as are Neil's credits (.help neil).

3) This code is never to be sold or passed off as anyone else's work.

Also, if the code IS modified and redistributed it would be nice if you include
a file summarising the changes made.

This package also includes code written from scratch by me (ncat, userinfo) 
and this is again freeware which may be freely modified and redistributed as 
long as my credits remain in the code. 

Portions of the freeware package Figlet v2.1.1 by Glenn Chappell and Ian Chai 
have been used. 

The GNU implementation of the Unix system call crypt() by Michael Glad  is 
included here to provide support for MS-Windows and FreeBSD compilations.

It would also be nice if you included a small note on either the MOTD1 or MOTD2 file
saying that the talker is based on Crypt code.  (Unlike Simon Marsh I won't insist
on this ;)
